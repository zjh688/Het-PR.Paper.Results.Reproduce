These cides are for reproducing all results in paper Stratifying Alzheimer’s Disease by Patient-Specific Genetic Signatures Reveals Cognition-Linked and Cross-Disease Heterogeneity.
They includes Simulation, ADNI Alz GWAS data Fitting, hierical clustering for AD patients, preparing Enrichment Analysis SNP/Gene, finding Cognitive characterization and Epilepsy-associated genetic variants.
Model file is the main code file for Het Pr model.
Data generation file and simulation_main file are for simulation.
Prepare ALZ Data and Fit ALZ data is code for preparing ADNI Alz GWAS data, fitting prepared data on Het Pr model, doing hierical clustering, preparing Enrichment Analysis SNP/Gene and finding Cognitive characterization.
Cross Disease Association file is for finding Epilepsy-associated genetic variants.
